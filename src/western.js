    <h4><b>Western dress codes are a set of dress codes detailing what clothes are worn for what occasion. Conversely, since most cultures have intuitively applied some level equivalent to the more formal Western dress code traditions, these dress codes are simply a versatile framework, open to amalgamation of international and local customs. This versatility has made this scale of formality a practical international formality scale.

    Classifications are divided into formal wear (full dress), semi-formal wear (half dress), and informal wear . Anything below this level is referred to as casual wear, although sometimes in combinations such as "smart casual" or "business casual" in order to indicate higher expectation than none at all.Much of the popularity of western clothes can be attributed to the fact that western countries are the center of education and business. They attract students and professionals from all over the world. Hollywood films also played an important role in making western clothes popular all over the world.

    The biggest advantage of wearing western clothes is that they protect the wearer from dress-based discrimination. This is important in the modern world where people are migrating to foreign nations to study or work. An Asian student wearing western outfits on a campus in the US or Europe is less likely to feel cultural alienation. The fact that he is also wearing the same outfits as other students on the campus makes it easy for him to fit into the new surroundings.
