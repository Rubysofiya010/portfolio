    <h4>A boutique is a small retail store that focuses on selling unique items, or items targeted at a niche market. These shops are established to sell a wide range of things, although products like clothing, food, or jewelry are common offerings. Many people associate boutiques with elite, special products, and they may pay a premium for goods purchased there. Many resort towns and areas that cater to wealthy populations have a high concentration of such stores in their shopping districts.

    At one point, any small shop was considered a boutique, and most stores could be included under the definition since merchants usually focused on a single product, like fabric, produce, or fish. The word is French in origin, and derived from the Old French word botica, for apothecary. Around the 1950s, people starting referring to specialized, elite fashion shops as “boutiques.” This meaning of the word quickly obscured previous usages, and spread to include any highly specialized or fashionable store.
    
    Some upscale Caribbean resorts have a boutique shop that offers high-end, locally made clothing.

    Many people think of a this type of store as a standalone shop with a single owner. Some high-end shopping chains actually own multiple boutiques, however, and these stores may be scattered in wealthy areas all over the world. Chain stores sell specialized products and target a very specific market, just like their standalone counterparts. They may have very well marketed and recognized brands; Tiffany's is a good example of one with international branches, with its distinctive little blue boxes and their contents being prized and coveted objects for some people.</h4></div>
